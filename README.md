BiblioPixel Serial Receiver
========

This is a stripped down version of the firmware used in the AllPixel for use with any serial capable Arduino compatible platform. All that is needed is to update the config options at the top of `BiblioPixelSerialReceiver.ino` and then use DriverSerial from BiblioPixel.
